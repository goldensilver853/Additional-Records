To add a record into the mod, make sure you have converted your music file to OGG format. Next rename the file to cd(any number 1 - 16, no spaces) and insert the respective disc into the jukebox. If you load a disc that has no music to play, it will simply play nothing. You will get an error in the console saying [01:39:44] [Client thread/WARN]: Unable to play empty soundEvent: records:records.cd(number)
